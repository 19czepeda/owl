Revision History
================

v0.3.x - User Geometries
------------------------

*v0.3.4*: bugfix: adding bounds prog broke bounds buffer variant. fixed.

*v0.3.4*: first 'serious' example: RTOW-finalChapter on OWL

- added `s05-rtow` example that runs Pete's "final chapter" example 
  (iterative version) on top of OWL, with multi-device, different material, etc.

*v0.3.3*: major bugfix in bounds program for geoms w/ more than 128 prims.

*v0.3.2*: added two explicit examples for uesr geom - one with
  host-generation of bounds passed thrugh buffer, and one with bounds
  program

*v0.3.1*: First draft of *device-side* user prim bounds generation

- added `groupBuildPrimitiveBounds` function that builds, for a
  user geom group, all the the primbounds required for the respective
  user geoms and prims in that group. The input for the user geoms' 
  bounding bxo functions is generated using same callback mechanism
  as sbt writing.

*v0.3.0*: First example of user geometry working

- can create user geometries through `createUserGeom`, and set
  type's isec program through `setGeomTypeIntersect`
- supports passing of new `userGeomSetBoundsBuffer` fct to pass user
  geoms through a buffer
- first example (8 sphere geometries, each with one sphere per geom)
  available as `s03-userGeometry`

v0.2.x
------

*v0.2.1*: multiple triangle meshes working
- multiple triangle meshes in same group debugged and working
- added `ll02-multipleTriangleGroups` sample that generates 8 boxes

*v0.2.0*: first triangle mesh with trace and SBT data working
- finalized `llTest` sample that ray traced image of one (tessellated) box

v0.1.x
------

- first version that does "some" sort of launch with mostly functional SBT
